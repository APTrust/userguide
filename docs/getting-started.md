# Welcome to APTrust

The Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust) repository is a distributed dark
archive preservation repository that uses cloud technologies to increase
efficiency and reliabilty.

## What do you need?
After you joined the APtrust community as either a sustaining member, subaccount
or trial user you will receive "Welcome emails" that furnish you with account
credentials and initial information to get started.

### Account on Pharos
Pharos is our web application and REST API that allows you access to the
repository and lets you manage deposits and restores.

An initial welcome email will be sent to you with credentials in order to make
your first login.

We distinguish two environments, https://repo.aptrust.org as production
environment which is intended for preservation, and https://demo.aptrust.org as
demo/test/trial environment that gives you the opportunity to test your
preservation workflows without compromising important digital content.
