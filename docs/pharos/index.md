# Using Pharos

## Logging In

If you don't already have a Pharos account, contact the APTrust administrator at your organization to set one up.

If your organization does not yet have an account, contact help@aptrust.org to get set up.

Once you have an account, log in with your email address to either the demo system or the production system.

* Demo: https://demo.aptrust.org

* Production: https://repo.aptrust.org

You'll be asked to change your password the first time you log in. Depending on your organization's security settings, you may also be asked to activate two-factor authentication. For more on that, see [Two Factor Authentication](two_factor_auth.md).

Note that because the demo and production systems are separate, you will have to reset your password on __each__ system the first time you log in. You can have different passwords and different two-factor authentication settings for each system.

## Forgot Your Password?

If you forget your password, go to the appropriate login page above (Demo or Production) and click the _Forgot your password?_ link next to the __Sign In__ button. The system will email you instructions on how to proceed.
