# Configuring Restoration Spot Tests

Restoration spot tests periodically restore a single, random intellectual object to your institution's restoration bucket. When the spot test completes, APTrust sends an email to your institution's users and admins telling them a restored item is available for download.

These spot tests aim to ensure:

1. That APTrust can successfully restore an object to your receiving bucket.
1. That your institution can make sense of the object, and can import it back into your institutional repository or DAMS, if necessary.

To configure spot tests for your institution:

1. Click __More Options__ in the left navigation bar.

1. Click __Institution__.

1. Click __Edit__.

1. Set __Restoration spot test frequency__ to the number of days you'd like between tests. Common options are 30, 60, or 90 days. __You can disable spot tests by setting days to zero.__

1. Click Submit.
